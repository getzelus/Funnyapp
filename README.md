# Funnyapp

Mobile app (mostly for Android) made with React Native Expo, React Native Paper, Redux Thunk, Expo Threejs.

To run it on your machine : npm install and expo start (if you have expo cli). Then, run in browser or try on mobile with Expo go. 

The API is Open Movie Database : https://www.omdbapi.com/

You need to register and get a key, then write it in src/utils/settings or stay in mode Without api key. 

You need to be online to use the app.

The first use of this app is to browse movies (titles and posters) and fav it. 

Then you can play a game where you have to touch the screen to explode cubes covered by your favourite posters ! 


# Ideas : 

Better reaction to touch. 

Store favs in local storage. 

Offline mode with local posters.

Count points with levels. 

Augmented reality. 

Use textures for cubes from local files. 

Use music frequency to change the spawning of cubes.
